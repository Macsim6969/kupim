Those who do not want to spend time and effort to find a client, it is better to use the service 'auto buyout. Of course you will not get the maximum value for the car, but 90-95% of the market value we guarantee you!<br/><br/> However, if you decide to sell a used car on your own, it is recommended to be patient. Selling a car on your own can take months. At the same time, without understanding the market, it is difficult to set a price that will suit both you and the potential buyer. As a result, you will waste your time and efforts."
